# Sharptimizer: An Opytimizer-Sister-Based Nature-Inspired Library

## Welcome to Sharptimizer.
Did you ever reach a bottleneck in your computational experiments? Are you tired of selecting suitable parameters for a chosen technique? If yes, Sharptimizer is the real deal! This package provides an easy-to-go implementation of meta-heuristic optimizations. From agents to search space, from internal functions to external communication, we will foster all research related to optimizing stuff.

* Original python version at [opytimizer](https://github.com/gugarosa/opytimizer)

Use Sharptimizer if you need a library or wish to:
* Create your optimization algorithm;
* Design or use pre-loaded optimization tasks;
* Mix-and-match different strategies to solve your problem;
* Because it is fun to optimize things.

Sharptimizer is compatible with: **.Net core 5.0+**.
